## Objective

The goal of this project was to build a Java-based application that helps manage company and investor information, as well as shareholding activities such as dividends, voting, and managing shareholder details. The program uses Object-Oriented Programming principles and incorporates event-driven functionality in a GUI environment.

### Skills Learned
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, focusing on concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Event-driven programming for interactive menus and user choices.
- Development and management of data structures to store company and investor details.
- File handling for adding investors from external files.
- Debugging, testing, and refining code in an IDE (Eclipse).
- Version control and GitHub repository management.

### Tools Used
- **Java (JDK 11)**: Primary programming language for developing the system.
- **Eclipse IDE**: Development environment used for coding, testing, and debugging.
- **GitHub**: Version control for managing the codebase.
- **Menus and File Management**: Interactive menus for user choices and integration of file handling for importing investor details.
